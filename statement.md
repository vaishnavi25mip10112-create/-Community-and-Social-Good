Community Resource Navigator: Project Brief

Problem Statement

Vulnerable individuals including low-income families, homeless persons, and those facing emergencies cannot easily locate essential community services. Information about food banks, shelters, and health clinics is scattered across different sources, frequently outdated, and requires internet access that many people lack. This creates barriers for those who urgently need help, forcing them to spend valuable time and limited resources searching for assistance. The absence of a centralized, offline-accessible system means people in crisis often miss available services when they need them most.
